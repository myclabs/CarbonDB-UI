    <h1>Known bugs / drawbacks</h1>
    Here are some known disturbing bugs and drawbacks, and, whenever possible, how to deal with them.
    <h2>Unsolved yet</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2014-10-29 <strong>Redimensioning the graph page makes arrows disappear.</strong>
            If this happens to you please just refresh the page, this should solve the problem.</li>
        <li>2014-10-15 <strong>Confusing display of graph.</strong>
            At this stage graph display is confusing, since global positionning of cells is random,
        and graph topology (arrows) is not taken into account. We will try to improve that in next future.
        In the meantime no solution except use drag and drop to reorganize, at least locally, the graph.</li>
        <li>2014-10-08 <strong>Missing tree and/or graph on the corresponding pages.</strong>
            Sometimes the categories tree or/and the graph disappear(s).
            If this happens to you please just refresh the page, this should solve the problem.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Solved</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2014-10-09 <strong> Missing arrows on the graph, with Firefox.</strong>
            Solved on 2014-10-09.</li>
    </ul>
